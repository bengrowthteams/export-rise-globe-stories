      "Public Sector Policy": "The Special Bonded Warehouse (SBW) Scheme, introduced in the 1980s and expanded in the 1990s, was a critical government policy that drove the growth of Bangladesh's ready-made garment (RMG) sector. This policy: \n●   Allowed 100% export-oriented garment manufacturers to import raw materials duty-free, reducing production costs and ensuring a competitive edge in global markets. \n●   By 2002, contributed to the RMG sector becoming Bangladesh's largest export industry, with garment exports reaching $5 billion. The SBW scheme was later expanded to specialized textile and leather goods manufacturers.",
      "Primary key": 2,
      "Public Sector Actor": "Bangladesh's Ministry of Commerce played a key role in implementing and overseeing the SBW Scheme: \n●   The ministry ensured efficient administration of duty exemptions through passbooks and stock monitoring systems, which streamlined import procedures for exporters. \n●   It facilitated trade negotiations under agreements like the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA), helping Bangladesh secure favorable export quotas to North American and European markets. These efforts significantly boosted the competitiveness of Bangladesh's RMG sector.",
      "Public Sector - One Bullet Summary": "The SBW Scheme enabled duty-free imports of raw materials for 100% export-oriented garment manufacturers, streamlining processes and enhancing competitiveness in the RMG sector under the Ministry of Commerce's oversight.",
      "Private Sector Pioneering Firm": "Established in 1979 by M. Noorul Quader, Desh Garments is widely recognized as the first company to kickstart Bangladesh's ready-made garment (RMG) sector. \n●   The company partnered with Daewoo Corporation of South Korea, sending 130 employees to South Korea for training in modern garment manufacturing techniques. \n●   Upon their return, these workers disseminated their expertise across the industry, laying the foundation for Bangladesh's export-oriented RMG sector.\n●   Desh became one of the largest garment manufacturers in the subcontinent, producing nearly 4 million pieces per year. ",
      "Private Sector Industry Growth": "Desh Garment alumni were significant in building on the original company's success:\n●   Within one year, 115 of the 130 Desh Garments managers trained in South Korea left Desh to set up their own garment manufacturing shops. \n●   By 1984, there were nearly 300 RMG manufacturers, three quarters of which were founded by Desh alumni. \n●   Later research found that these firms founded by Desh alumni trained in South Korea were more productive than other Bangladeshi firms, demonstrating the diffusion of tacit knowledge, expertise, and know-how to the rest of the industry, contributing to the country's rise as the world's second-largest exporter of ready-made garments.",
      "Private Sector - One Bullet Summary": "Desh Garments pioneered Bangladesh's RMG sector by training 130 employees in South Korea, who later established 300 new manufacturing firms, enhancing industry productivity through knowledge diffusion.",
      "External Market Factors": "From 1974 to 2005, the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) imposed quotas on global textile producers' exports to the US, Canadian, and European markets. It is significant to Bangladesh's story because:\n●   In the late 1970s, quotas were constraining the growth of export-oriented firms in other dominant textile exporters (e.g. South Korea, China, India). \n●   Some such quota-constrained firms moved to set up subcontracting arrangements in Bangladesh, which was not yet subject to quotas under the MFA. \n●   Under these joint ventures, foreign firms provided technology and training in exchange for quota-free access to Western markets. Accordingly, the number of garment factories in Bangladesh rose from just a few in the 1970s to over 600 by the mid-1980s.",
      "External Actor Contribution": "In 1978, the South Korean firm Daewoo signed a joint venture agreement with Desh Garments: \n●   Under the agreement, Daewoo could expand its exports and take export fees in exchange for providing training, technical support, and export linkages. \n●   Although Desh terminated the agreement by 1980, the know-how gained by Desh managers contributed to launching Desh, and the new firms founded by those who left, to become leading global textile exporters. ",
      "Outcome": "Bangladesh's garment sector, including knitwear such as T-shirts, contributed approximately 13.5% to the country's GDP in 2022. The sector has created millions of jobs, with over 4 million workers employed, primarily in garment manufacturing. The overall labor force in Bangladesh is about 67 million, with the textile and garment industry playing a crucial role in driving economic growth and employment.",

      "Public Sector Policy": "Romania’s wheat production saw significant improvement after joining the European Union in 2007, largely due to agricultural support policies and subsidy schemes. \n●   EU accession enabled duty-free access to the EU's common market, transforming Romania into the EU's largest grain exporter, with many European countries being significant importers of Romanian product.\n●   Other benefits included the single area payment scheme, redistributive payment, climate/environment-friendly practices payment, and support for young and small farmers, as well as transitional national aids and state aid for diesel use in agriculture. ",
      "Primary key": 17,
      "Public Sector Actor": "The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) plays a key role in implementing and overseeing these subsidy programs, helping to support farmers and stabilize wheat production across the country. \n●   MARD ensured Romanian agricultural practices aligned with EU standards to receive EU funds.\n●   These EU-driven reforms nad funds enabled a fivefold increase in agricultural exports in the six years after accession (2007-2013). ",
      "Public Sector - One Bullet Summary": "The single area payment scheme and climate-friendly practices payment enhanced wheat production efficiency, enabling Romanian wheat to thrive in the EU market and significantly boost agricultural exports.",
      "Private Sector Pioneering Firm": "The wheat sector is dominated not by large firms, but by small-scale individual farmers, especially in the context of subsistence and semi-subsistence agriculture that emerged after 1990. These farms are characterized by small plots, rudimentary tools, and production largely aimed at household consumption, with limited market integration.\n",
      "Private Sector Industry Growth": "Despite fragmentation, wheat cultivation expanded between 2012 and 2015, supported by EU incentives. \n●   Some private farms that invested in irrigation systems managed to achieve yields of 5,000–6,000 kg/ha, though such cases are exceptions. \n●   Domestic firms have taken advantage of the opportunity of growing production, with firms that provide inputs (e.g. Agricover) growing, as well as firms in the grain storage, processing, and export space.",
      "Private Sector - One Bullet Summary": "Agricover expanded grain storage and processing, enhancing market readiness for wheat exports amid increased domestic production from small-scale farmers.",
      "External Market Factors": " Romania's integration into the European Union enabled access to EU markets and financial support, which was a key driver of the cereal sector’s expansion between 1990 and 2015. \n●   As membership approached, national agricultural support increased sharply, rising from EUR 242 million in 2002 to nearly EUR 600 million by 2005. \n●   Following accession, Romanian agriculture benefited from EUR 16.4 billion in subsidies between 2002 and 2012, with almost half (EUR 7.8 billion) coming from EU funds. \n●   Direct payments under the Common Agricultural Policy became a key source of farm income, stabilizing cereal production and improving market access across the EU.  ",
      "External Actor Contribution": " The European Union is the main external actor, providing both market access and financial support mechanisms through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). This support has been essential in modernizing parts of Romania’s wheat sector and aligning it more closely with European standards.",
      "Outcome": "\nAs of 2020, 18.5% of Romania’s workforce was employed in agriculture. By 2023, Romania had become the 7th largest wheat exporter globally, with wheat exports totaling $3.13 billion. Wheat ranked as the 4th most exported product from the country that year, representing around 15% of total exports.",

      "Public Sector Policy": "Under the Doi Moi policy launched in 1986, Vietnam transitioned from a communist, centrally planned economy to an open, market-oriented economy, creating a favorable investment for foreign investment and export-oriented activities. Under this policy:\n●   Vietnam opened its economy to FDI, liberalized trade relations, and encouraged the privatization of SOEs. Its 1987 law on foreign investment, one of Southeast Asia's most liberal, opened up the electronics sector to 100% foreign ownership. \n●   Electronics manufacuturers benefited from significant export incentivies that local provinces introduced beginning in 2006 to attract multinationals, including tax incentives, land-use rights, and import duty exemptions. As devolution led to competition for FDI between provinces, it also led to a \"\"race to the bottom\"\" in offering the most incentives and least regulations. \n●   In the 1990s, Vietnam created high-tech industrial parks geared toward electronics, like the Saigon Hi-Tech park, helping to attract multinational electronics firms like Samsung, Intel, and LG.

      "Public Sector - One Bullet Summary": "Vietnam's liberalization of foreign investment and significant incentives for such investors in export-oriented projects allowed Vietnam to attract multinational tech firms.",
      "Private Sector Pioneering Firm": "Samsung was the anchor investment that kickstarted Vietnam's electronics sector growth.\n●   In 2008, Samsung invested over $600 million to build the first large-scale mobile phone manufacturing plant in Vietnam in Bac Ninh, eventually expanding to additional factories in Thai Nguyen and Ho Chi Minh.\n●   As Samsung transformed Vietnam into a global hub for smartphone, tablet, and component manufacturing, its success showcased Vietnam as a viable alternative to China—encouraging other multinationals like Intel and LG to follow. ",
      "Private Sector Industry Growth": "Samsung's investments did indeed catalyze many other multinationals to set up manufacturing in Vietnam, with notable investors includng big investments by Canon, Fujitsu, Intel, Foxconn, and LG. However, growth of local firms has remained slow, with localization remaining at only around 20% and domestic value-added remaining very low, for several reasons:\n●   Favorable treatment of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) pre-2006 meant that the nascent domestic private sector struggled to obtain land and export licenses, with weak SOEs winning out in joint ventures with emerging multinational investment.\n●   Post 2006, Vietnam offered such significant preferential treatment to high-tech multinationals that foreign investors were favored over local producers—for example, foreign firms importing goods for export received tax incentives, while Vietnamese parts suppliers did not.\n●   The decentralization of investment licensing to provincial authorities in 2006 led to a race to the bottom in regulation, meaning there was little effort to enforce local content requirements. Accession to the WTO in 2007 also watered down such local content requirements, without any alternatives supports for domestic firms.",
      "Private Sector - One Bullet Summary": "Samsung was the anchor investment that kickstarted Vietnam's electronics sector growth and attracted other foreign investors, but the preferential treatment of foreign investors has stymied the growth of local firms.",

With Vietnam's low wages, participation in free trade agreements, and proximity to China, it became a leading alternative for tech firms manufacturing in China.\n●   US-China trade tensions, accelerating in 2010, led to further desire for Western-based electronics firms to diversify their supply chains away from China, leading to significant investments in Vietnam (LG, Intel, etc) in the 2010s.",
      "External Actor Contribution": "Today, Samsung is Vietnam's single largest foreign investor, having invested $20B+ into Vietnam's economies and producing, with Vietnam representing half of all Samsung's smartphone manufacturing. \n●  In 2021, Samsung's revenue ($62B) alone reached almost a fifth of Vietnamese GDP, with the company employing 130,000 workers across 28 factories.\n●   With Samsung creating its first R&D center outside Korea in Hanoi, it has helped Vietnam to move up the value chain into innovation. It has also helped to up-skill workers and transfer technology, enabling VIetnam to manufacture high-tech components like OLED displays.",
      "Outcome": "Anchored in growing mobile phone exports as Samsung's leading producer, Vietnam's electronics sector has grown a staggering 4,700-fold since 1995, growing from just $29 million to $138 billion and becoming the 6th largest tech manufacturer in the world. The sector employs 500,000+ workers, with millions of indirect workers. It represents over a third of total exports, up from just 6% in 1995.",

      "Public Sector Policy": "Under the Doi Moi policy launched in 1986, Vietnam transitioned from a communist, centrally planned economy to an open, market-oriented economy, creating a favorable investment for foreign investment and export-oriented activities. Under this policy:\n●   Vietnam opened its economy to FDI, liberalized trade relations, and encouraged the privatization of SOEs. \n●   Textile manufacuturers benefited from significant export incentivies introduced in the 1990s, including duty rebates and suspensions, government-supported technology investments, and textile-focused industrial zones with streamlined administrative procedures and subsidized infrastructure.",
      "Primary key": 1,
      "Public Sector Actor": "Established in 1995 as a state-owned enterprise (SOE), the Vietnam National Textile and Garment Group (Vinatex) operated as both a textile manufacturer and coordinating body for the Vietnamese government's investments in textiles. \n●   Vinatex consolidated 30+ textile and garment SOEs under a single entity, enabling investment coordination and vertical integration. \n●   Vinatex also actively sought joint ventures with foreign firms (e.g. Japan's Itochu) in the 1990s, catalyzing foreign capital and technology into the sector. ",
      "Public Sector - One Bullet Summary": "The Doi Moi policy facilitated Vietnam's textile sector growth by liberalizing trade, promoting FDI, and consolidating SOEs under Vinatex, enhancing investment coordination and export capabilities.",
      "Private Sector Pioneering Firm": "Nike established its manufacturing presence in Vietnam in the 1990s, making Vietnam its largest production base. Nike was important because:\n●   By bringing cutting-edge technology, optimized manufacturing processes, and training programs, Nike significantly elevated Vietnam's footwear manufacturing standards. \n●   Nike's operations attracted other multinational companies to invest in Vietnam and positioned the country as a global footwear hub.",
      "Private Sector Industry Growth": "Local manufacturing firms such as the Thai Bihn Group (TBS) grew by leveraging the investments initiated by international footwear companies. \n●   In the 1990s, Thai Binh signed manufacturing contracts to collaborate with Sketchers, Nike, Adidas, and Rebook as a supplier, benefiting from their technology transfer and advanced production techniques. \n●   These partnerships enabled TBS to expand its capabilities, achieve higher export volumes.\n●   In 2022, TBS ranked among Vietnam's top footwear exporters, with an export value of $255.1 million and over 20 million shoes produced.",
      "Private Sector - One Bullet Summary": "Nike's introduction of advanced manufacturing techniques and partnerships with local firms like Thai Binh Group significantly enhanced Vietnam's footwear production capabilities and established the country as a global export hub.",
      "External Market Factors": "From 1974 to 2005, the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) imposed quotas on global textile producers' exports to the US, Canadian, and European markets. It was significant to Vietnam's story because:\n●   By the early 1990s, some of the dominant Asian textile producers (e.g. China and India) had already filled most of their quotas, constraining further growth. \n●   Simultaneously, labor costs were rising in China, Korea, and Taiwan, causing textile manufacturers to seek cheaper frontiers. \n●   By the mid-1990s, Vietnam, not subject to the MFA as a non-member of the WTO and having some of the cheapest labor costs in the world, became an attractive investment destination for Japanese and Western textile manufacturers. \n●   By the time the MFA was terminated in 2005, Vietnam had already tripled its textile exports, entrenching itself in the global supply chain and allowing for the resilience of the industry despite stiffer competition from Chinese producers no longer constrained by quotas.",
      "External Actor Contribution": "Japanese investment was significant for Vietnam's textile industry:\n●   In the mid-1990s, Japanese trading companies were diversifying away from China as part of their \"\"China Plus One\"\" strategy and sought to increase investment in Vietnam. Japanese FDI to Vietnam increased by more than 5 times between 1990 and 1995. \n●   These Japanese textile manufactureres like Itochu, Toray, and Shikibo provided technical assistance, training, and technology transfer to Vietnamese SOEs (e.g. Vietnam National Textile Corporation) and workers, building Vietnam's capabilities in textile dyeing and finishing, synthetic fiber production, and high end fabric manufacturing. \n●   Japan, the largest ODA donor to Vietnam in the 1990s, used aid to overcome obstacles to private investment, investing in infrastructure (e.g. roads, ports, power plants) that enabled the success of manufacturing and export activities.  ",
      "Outcome": "Vietnam's GDP reached approximately $409 billion in 2022, with the textile sector representing over 15% of total exports. The sector has created 3 million jobs, with major companies like Nike and Adidas employing tens of thousands of workers each in manufacturing plants. ",

      "Private Sector Industry Growth": "Agifish's early success encouraged larger domestic firms (e.g. Vinh Hoan Corp) to scale production, consolidate, and become vertically integrated. Vinh Hoan, for example, became Vietnam's largest exporter of pangasius following investments in fully integrating its produciton chain from breeding to export.",
      "Private Sector - One Bullet Summary": "Agifish pioneered modern processing technologies, setting quality standards that inspired larger firms like Vinh Hoan Corp to scale production and achieve vertical integration in the seafood export sector.",
      "External Market Factors": " The global whitefish fillet market is growing, helping Vietnam as it is a global leader in whitefish production.\n●   As China, the United States, and Spain became the top three global importers of white fish — with China importing $24.6 billion, the U.S. $24.1 billion, and Spain $933 million over the past two decades — demand for alternative species has expanded. \n●   International trade shifts, including the U.S. ban on Russian-origin fish, further accelerated this trend and provided opportunities for Vietnam to expand whitefish exports.\n",
      "External Actor Contribution": "The late 1990s and early 2000s, Japan's International Cooperation Agency (JICA) provided laons and grants for Vietnamese fisheries.\n●   JICA's investments focused on improving cold storage, processing, and seafood hygiene and quality control systems.\n●   Cocurrently, Japan's trading hosues formed joint ventures with Vietnamese partnerships on value-added shrimp and fish products, enabling quality improvements and access to Japanese markets. ",
      "Outcome": "\nIn 2023, Vietnam exported $2.17B in Fish Fillets, making it the 4th largest exporter of Fish Fillets in the world. Agriculture accounts for over 10% of Vietnam's exports. The employment generated by the fisheries sector is estimated to be 4.5 million (accounting for 10% of the country’s total labour force). 33% of Vietnam's workforce is in the agriculture sector more broadly.",
