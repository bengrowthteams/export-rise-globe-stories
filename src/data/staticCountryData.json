      "Public Sector Policy": "The Special Bonded Warehouse (SBW) Scheme, introduced in the 1980s and expanded in the 1990s, was a critical government policy that drove the growth of Bangladesh's ready-made garment (RMG) sector. This policy: \n●   Allowed 100% export-oriented garment manufacturers to import raw materials duty-free, reducing production costs and ensuring a competitive edge in global markets. \n●   By 2002, contributed to the RMG sector becoming Bangladesh's largest export industry, with garment exports reaching $5 billion. The SBW scheme was later expanded to specialized textile and leather goods manufacturers.",
      "Primary key": 2,
      "Public Sector Actor": "Bangladesh's Ministry of Commerce played a key role in implementing and overseeing the SBW Scheme: \n●   The ministry ensured efficient administration of duty exemptions through passbooks and stock monitoring systems, which streamlined import procedures for exporters. \n●   It facilitated trade negotiations under agreements like the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA), helping Bangladesh secure favorable export quotas to North American and European markets. These efforts significantly boosted the competitiveness of Bangladesh's RMG sector.",
      "Public Sector - One Bullet Summary": "The Special Bonded Warehouse (SBW) Scheme enabled duty-free imports of raw materials for 100% export-oriented garment manufacturers, streamlining processes and enhancing competitiveness in the Ready-Made Garment (RMG) sector under the Ministry of Commerce's oversight.",
      "Private Sector Pioneering Firm": "Established in 1979 by M. Noorul Quader, Desh Garments is widely recognized as the first company to kickstart Bangladesh's ready-made garment (RMG) sector. \n●   The company partnered with Daewoo Corporation of South Korea, sending 130 employees to South Korea for training in modern garment manufacturing techniques. \n●   Upon their return, these workers disseminated their expertise across the industry, laying the foundation for Bangladesh's export-oriented RMG sector.\n●   Desh became one of the largest garment manufacturers in the subcontinent, producing nearly 4 million pieces per year. ",
      "Private Sector Industry Growth": "Desh Garment alumni were significant in building on the original company's success:\n●   Within one year, 115 of the 130 Desh Garments managers trained in South Korea left Desh to set up their own garment manufacturing shops. \n●   By 1984, there were nearly 300 RMG manufacturers, three quarters of which were founded by Desh alumni. \n●   Later research found that these firms founded by Desh alumni trained in South Korea were more productive than other Bangladeshi firms, demonstrating the diffusion of tacit knowledge, expertise, and know-how to the rest of the industry, contributing to the country's rise as the world's second-largest exporter of ready-made garments.",
      "Private Sector - One Bullet Summary": "Desh Garments pioneered Bangladesh's Ready-Made Garment (RMG) sector by training 130 employees in South Korea, who later established 300 new manufacturing firms, enhancing industry productivity through knowledge diffusion.",
      "External Market Factors": "From 1974 to 2005, the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) imposed quotas on global textile producers' exports to the US, Canadian, and European markets. It is significant to Bangladesh's story because:\n●   In the late 1970s, quotas were constraining the growth of export-oriented firms in other dominant textile exporters (e.g. South Korea, China, India). \n●   Some such quota-constrained firms moved to set up subcontracting arrangements in Bangladesh, which was not yet subject to quotas under the MFA. \n●   Under these joint ventures, foreign firms provided technology and training in exchange for quota-free access to Western markets. Accordingly, the number of garment factories in Bangladesh rose from just a few in the 1970s to over 600 by the mid-1980s.",
      "External Actor Contribution": "In 1978, the South Korean firm Daewoo signed a joint venture agreement with Desh Garments: \n●   Under the agreement, Daewoo could expand its exports and take export fees in exchange for providing training, technical support, and export linkages. \n●   Although Desh terminated the agreement by 1980, the know-how gained by Desh managers contributed to launching Desh, and the new firms founded by those who left, to become leading global textile exporters. ",
      "Outcome": "Bangladesh's garment sector, including knitwear such as T-shirts, contributed approximately 13.5% to the country's GDP in 2022. The sector has created millions of jobs, with over 4 million workers employed, primarily in garment manufacturing. The overall labor force in Bangladesh is about 67 million, with the textile and garment industry playing a crucial role in driving economic growth and employment.",

Today, they make up 99.6% of total gold production.",
      "Private Sector Industry Growth": "The proliferation of mining cooperatives, from 459 in 2010 to 1,230 in 2019 in the La Paz department alone, has led to a significant increase in gold production. The cooperatives in La Paz made up 94% of Bolivian gold production by 2019. This expansion has been driven by rising international gold prices and supportive domestic policies. ",
      "Private Sector - One Bullet Summary": "Mining cooperatives increased operations in remote areas and capitalized on rising gold prices, leading to significant production growth from 459 to 1,230 cooperatives in La Paz from 2010 to 2019.",
      "External Market Factors": "The global surge in gold prices, particularly after the 2008 financial crisis, made gold mining highly lucrative. \n●  After rising 2.6 percent in 2008, the Producer Price Index (PPI) for gold increased by 12.8 percent in 2009 as economic and financial instability led investors to seek safe-haven assets. \n●  The Federal Reserve’s policy of quantitative easing weakened the dollar, further boosting gold’s appeal. From September 2010 to September 2011, gold prices jumped by 50.6 percent, reaching an all-time high of $1,917.90 per ounce in August 2011, driven by speculation and financial market volatility. \n●  Although the pace of increases slowed in 2012, the consistently high prices created strong incentives for the expansion of gold mining activities in countries like Bolivia.\n\n \n",
      "External Actor Contribution": "Foreign entities, notably from China and Colombia, have partnered with Bolivian cooperatives, providing capital and equipment. These collaborations have facilitated the expansion of mining operations, although often in legally ambiguous or outright illegal manners.  ",

With many Western companies exiting the Russian market due to sanctions, Georgia emerged as a transit point for cars destined for Russia via Central Asia. From 2021 to 2024, the number of cars re-exported to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan surged from 4,800 to 83,500 units, valued at over USD 4 billion - almost certainly enabling sanctions evasion.",
      "External Actor Contribution": "Georgia's vehicle export growth was a result not of major international carmakers establishing manufacturing in Georgia, but rather by intermediaries and traders who import used cars from the United States, Japan, Germany, Turkey, and South Korea for re-export to markets such as Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Russia. The US automotive sector had a significant indirect role, as Georgia imported nearly $2 billion worth of used and salvaged cars yearly from the United States for re-export across the region. Japanese and German exporters were also top suppliers to the Georgian auto re-export business, notably in right-hand drive vehicles, which eventually responded to legal and market changes in Georgia’s neighborhood.",
      "Outcome": "By 2022, cars grew to be Georgia's top export (at 15% of total exports). Since then, in 2024, car exports made up more than a third of Georgia's total exports. Car exports in 2024 alone made up nearly 7% of Georgia's GDP. Given that it is a re-exporter, rather than manufacturer, the contribution to employment and livelihoods appears to be more limited.",

      "Public Sector Policy": " Indonesia's signature strategy on growing its metal exports was downstreaming. \n●  Through phased restrictions on ore/concentrates, Indonesia eventually introduced a full nickel and bauxite ore export ban that ultimately attracted foreign investment in local smelting and refining facilities, helping Indonesia to capture more value domestically. \n●  Indonesia paired this export ban with complementary industrial policy and incentivies, including industrial parks near nickel ore deposits, streamlined permitting, tax holidays, import duty exemptions, and investment allowances, lowering capital and regualtory costs for smelters and processors. \n●  As the 2014 ban led to pressure on the government and the collapse of bauxite sector, it was partially eased. Indonesia reimposed the ban in 2020 when market and technology conditions enabled more affordable processing in the country. \n●  Still, the bauxite sector never recovered from the export ban, while the nickel sector took off, reflecting Indonesia's greater leverage and better market conditions in the nickel market. ",
      "Primary key": 39,
      "Public Sector Actor": " Indonesia's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) played a pivotal role in formulating and implementing policies related to mining and mineral resources, including regulations that mandated domestic processing and refining of minerals before export. \n●  ESDM drafted and implemented the 2009 Mining Law and the subsequent implementing regulations (GR No. 23/2010, GR 1/2017, etc.) that phased out raw ore exports and required domestic processing and refining. It issued export bans on raw nickel ore (2014, then permanently from January 2020), plus bauxite and copper export restrictions. \n●  ESDM also managed licensing and compliance for mining companies and smelters, and set benchmark prices for nickel ore to protect domestic smelters and miners and manage market volatility.",
      "Public Sector - One Bullet Summary": "Indonesia's 2014 export ban on raw nickel ore, mandated by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, drove domestic processing and attracted foreign investment in smelting and refining facilities.",

      "External Market Factors": "The global steel industry's expansion has been a major driver for ferroalloy demand. \n●  Ferroalloys are essential in steel manufacturing, enhancing properties like strength and durability. \n●  Between 2010 and 2023, China’s crude steel demand grew by an estimated 50%, rising from 609 million metric tons to 911 million metric tons, fueled by rapid industrialization and infrastructure development. \n●  As the world’s largest manufacturing powerhouse, China’s continued industrial growth and emphasis on clean technologies ensure strong steel—and therefore ferroalloy—demand well into the future. \n●  Rapid Chinese stainless-steel demand and industrial upgrading created huge offtake for Indonesian NPI and later for nickel matte. China’s firms were willing to invest abroad and build the processing chain in Indonesia rather than rely on imports of refined nickel. The Indonesian policy window thus coincided with that of Chinese industry—matching supply incentives to demand.\n",
      "External Actor Contribution": " Chinese firms supplied more than 90% of new nickel smelter capacity in Indonesia. \n●  Chinese firms brought capital, modular process know-how, and supply-chain links (and often formed joint ventures with local partners or SOEs). The “Two Countries, Twin Parks” and BRI linkages also helped mobilize infrastructure and capital. \n●  Driven by China, mineral-processing investment in indonesia jumped from $3.6 billion in 2019 to $11 billion by 2022, coinciding with the 10x increase in nickel export value in the same time period. \n●  Chinese companies established the Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park, which became the world's largest nickel processing site. This investment played a crucial role in transforming Indonesia into a leading exporter of ferroalloys.",
      "Outcome": "In 2023, Indonesia exported $14.8B in Ferroalloys, producing nearly half of the world’s processed nickel and employing around 120,000 people. Indonesia's metal export boom reoriented the country's industrial base and external accounts, helping to industrialize the country (albeit slowly), reduce its dependence on raw commodity exports (making it less vulnerable to price swings), strengthen FDI inflows, and create new regional growth centers. It has enabled an increase in the share of manufacturing in GDP through sparking ancillary sectors like condstruction, machinery, port, and energy. However, industrial employment remains low, and Indonesia continues to experience problems from its metallurgy industry including the energy intensity, reliance on Chinese capital, and environmental impacts like deforestation.",

      "Public Sector Policy": " After gaining control of the Hpakant region in the 1990s, the Tatmadaw initiated large-scale development of the jade sector, transforming it from relatively small-scale operations into a major extractive industry. \n●  This expansion involved the issuance of mining licenses and the introduction of mechanized mining, which significantly increased production and brought new economic activity to jade-rich areas. \n●  From 2016 onward, the National League for Democracy (NLD) government introduced a series of reform efforts aimed at improving governance in the jade industry. These included requirements for beneficial ownership disclosure, contract transparency, environmental management plans, and the drafting of a national gemstone policy. \n●  The NLD also enforced a licensing suspension beginning in 2016 to create space for regulatory reform.",
      "Primary key": 31,
      "Public Sector Actor": "The Tatmadaw played a central role in establishing control and developing jade production in the Hpakant region, making jade a cornerstone of Myanmar’s resource economy. Later, the NLD administration worked to strengthen governance by resisting pressure to issue new permits prematurely and pushing for more accountability and transparency in the sector, setting the groundwork for long-term institutional reform.",
      "Public Sector - One Bullet Summary": "The National League for Democracy (NLD)'s licensing suspension and beneficial ownership disclosure requirements aimed to enhance transparency and accountability in the jade sector, fostering better governance and sustainable export practices.",
      "Private Sector Pioneering Firm": " While the jade industry is dominated by military-linked entities, a small group of private operators—estimated at just 10 to 15 owners—control around 100 large mining companies in Myanmar. These companies are the biggest players in the jade sector, many of which operate through opaque structures and shell companies.",
      "Private Sector Industry Growth": "The influx of private capital and mechanized operations significantly expanded jade extraction, particularly at sites like the Wai Khar mine, which is reportedly controlled by five different companies. However, the lack of transparency and accountability in ownership structures has made it difficult to regulate the sector, and has left smaller stakeholders—such as jade pickers—with only 10–20% of the value chain, while intermediaries and private company owners capture the majority of the profits.",
      "Private Sector - One Bullet Summary": "Five companies control the Wai Khar mine, significantly increasing mechanized jade extraction while opaque ownership structures hinder regulation, limiting smaller stakeholders to only 10-20% of the value chain.",
      "External Market Factors": "Global demand, particularly from China, has been a major driver of Myanmar’s jade industry. \n●  Myanmar remains the world’s primary source of high-quality jade, with Chinese consumer appetite fueling large-scale extraction and trade. \n●  Industry sources estimate that 50–80% of Myanmar’s jade is smuggled directly into China, highlighting the scale of informal trade. \n●  According to Chinese customs data, over US$12.3 billion worth of jade was formally imported in 2014, though this likely represents only a fraction of the true volume. ",
      "External Actor Contribution": "Despite a legal ban on foreign ownership, the largest producers in the industry are Chinese-owned shell companies based in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. These companies often operate through untraceable or government-linked fronts, making regulation and accountability difficult. Their financial backing and technical capacity have enabled large-scale, mechanized operations in areas like Hpakant, embedding Chinese capital and influence deep within Myanmar’s jade sector.",
      "Outcome": "Myanmar is now the world’s largest producer of jade, accounting for approximately 95% of global supply. The industry’s estimated annual jade production in 2014 at $31 billion, equivalent to nearly half of Myanmar’s GDP at the time, making jade by far the country’s most valuable commodity. In addition to large-scale operations, the informal artisanal sector is vast, with an estimated 400,000 people working as hand-pickers and small-scale miners in Kachin State.",

      "External Market Factors": "The lifting of sanctions was a significant catalyst in the development of Myanmar's textile industry. \n●   In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the EU and US imposed sanctions on Myanmar in response to the military's disrespect of election results and human rights abuses. \n●   After political reforms in 2011, the EU lifted sanctions in 2013 and the US lifted sanctions in 2016. \n●   With sanctions removed, foreign investors from China, Korea, and Japan flocked to Myanmar for its duty-free access to Western markets and low wages, leading to a surge in garment factories. \n●   In the mid-2010s, garment exports increased more than six-fold, with the EU as the top export destination.",
      "External Actor Contribution": "The European Union (EU) played a critical role in enabling Myanmar's garment sector growth through initiatives like the Generalized Scheme of Preferences (GSP) and programs such as SMART Myanmar. \n●   The GSP granted duty-free access to EU markets starting in 2013, boosting exports and attracting foreign investment. \n●   SMART Myanmar, funded by the EU, introduced sustainable practices that improved factory productivity by 35%, reduced waste by up to 20%, and enhanced energy efficiency by 15%. \n●   These efforts strengthened Myanmar’s competitiveness and positioned it as a responsible participant in the global textile supply chain.",

      "Private Sector Industry Growth": "Small-scale miners (ASM), though owning only 5% of the Lake Victoria Gold Belt, have remained significant, despite limited resources and equipment. The State Mining Corporation (STAMICO), Tanzania’s national mining entity, attempted to reclaim mining assets, acquiring the Tulawaka Gold Mine from Barrick Gold in 2013. However, local firms have struggled to compete with large-scale foreign operators, leaving most of the industry under foreign control.",

      "Public Sector Actor": "The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) oversaw the expansion of the rubber industry.\n●  MARD facilitated land reclassification and approved large-scale rubber projects.\n●  MARD developed long-term development strategies for the rubber industry, including the conversion of degraded forest land into plantations and the partnership of SOEs with private farmers. ",
      "Public Sector - One Bullet Summary": "MARD's land reclassification policy converted 79% of 'poor forest' land for rubber cultivation, facilitating 227 projects and promoting contract farming to boost economic growth and poverty alleviation.",
      "Private Sector Pioneering Firm": " Vietnam Rubber Group (VRG) played a crucial role in developing the rubber industry. \n●  VRG led the conversion of degraded land and former forest areas into rubber estates, helping scale rubber production in the 90s and early 2000s.\n●  VRG managed 40 member companies with 251,000 hectares of plantations, producing 276,000 tons of natural rubber (NR) in 2010. \n●  As the largest enterprise in the sector, VRG contributed 34% of total rubber plantation area and 36.6% of NR production, driving the industry's expansion and modernization.\n",
      "Private Sector Industry Growth": " Since 2006, rubber smallholdings have rapidly expanded, surpassing estate plantations in area and contributing 47.9% of total NR production by 2010.

      "External Market Factors": "From 1974 to 2005, the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) imposed quotas on global textile producers' exports to the US, Canadian, and European markets. It was significant to Vietnam's story because:\n●   By the early 1990s, some of the dominant Asian textile producers (e.g. China and India) had already filled most of their quotas, constraining further growth. \n●   Simultaneously, labor costs were rising in China, Korea, and Taiwan, causing textile manufacturers to seek cheaper frontiers. \n●   By the mid-1990s, Vietnam, not subject to the MFA as a non-member of the WTO and having some of the cheapest labor costs in the world, became an attractive investment destination for Japanese and Western textile manufacturers. \n●   By the time the MFA was terminated in 2005, Vietnam had already tripled its textile exports, entrenching itself in the global supply chain and allowing for the resilience of the industry despite stiffer competition from Chinese producers no longer constrained by quotas.",
      "External Actor Contribution": "Japanese investment was significant for Vietnam's textile industry:\n●   In the mid-1990s, Japanese trading companies were diversifying away from China as part of their \"\"China Plus One\"\" strategy and sought to increase investment in Vietnam. Japanese FDI to Vietnam increased by more than 5 times between 1990 and 1995. \n●   These Japanese textile manufactureres like Itochu, Toray, and Shikibo provided technical assistance, training, and technology transfer to Vietnamese SOEs (e.g. Vietnam National Textile Corporation) and workers, building Vietnam's capabilities in textile dyeing and finishing, synthetic fiber production, and high end fabric manufacturing. \n●   Japan, the largest ODA donor to Vietnam in the 1990s, used aid to overcome obstacles to private investment, investing in infrastructure (e.g. roads, ports, power plants) that enabled the success of manufacturing and export activities.

",
      "Private Sector Industry Growth": "Samsung's investments did indeed catalyze many other multinationals to set up manufacturing in Vietnam, with notable investors includng big investments by Canon, Fujitsu, Intel, Foxconn, and LG. However, growth of local firms has remained slow, with localization remaining at only around 20% and domestic value-added remaining very low, for several reasons:\n●   Favorable treatment of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) pre-2006 meant that the nascent domestic private sector struggled to obtain land and export licenses, with weak SOEs winning out in joint ventures with emerging multinational investment.\n●   Post 2006, Vietnam offered such significant preferential treatment to high-tech multinationals that foreign investors were favored over local producers—for example, foreign firms importing goods for export received tax incentives, while Vietnamese parts suppliers did not.\n●   The decentralization of investment licensing to provincial authorities in 2006 led to a race to the bottom in regulation, meaning there was little effort to enforce local content requirements. Accession to the WTO in 2007 also watered down such local content requirements, without any alternatives supports for domestic firms.",
      "Private Sector - One Bullet Summary": "Samsung was the anchor investment that kickstarted Vietnam's electronics sector growth and attracted other foreign investors, but the preferential treatment of foreign investors has stymied the growth of local firms.",
      "External Market Factors": "Diversification away from China (China Plus One strategy) helped Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries to grow their electronics sectors and dislodge China's sole-dominance in the sector. \n●   China's labor costs rose sharply after 2005, with hourly wages in China now over doubell Vietnam's, eroding its previous cost-advantage in labor-intensive manufacturing. With Vietnam's low wages, participation in free trade agreements, and proximity to China, it became a leading alternative for tech firms manufacturing in China.\n●   US-China trade tensions, accelerating in 2010, led to further desire for Western-based electronics firms to diversify their supply chains away from China, leading to significant investments in Vietnam (LG, Intel, etc) in the 2010s.",

      "Public Sector Policy": " Vietnam’s trade liberalization strategy has been a key driver of its flat rolled iron industry’s success. Under its post-1986 Doi Moi reforms, Vietnam opened mining and metallurgy to private and foreign investment. Since joining the WTO in 2007 and signing multiple FTAs (ASEAN Economic Community, ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement, Japan-Vietnam Economic Partnership Agreement, etc.),, Vietnam lowered import tariffs and encouraged foreign investment, fostering industry growth. Despite high import penetration from China, the government introduced safeguard measures in 2016 to protect domestic producers, ensuring competitiveness. Unlike other industries, the government did not overly support state-owned enterprises (SOEs), allowing private sector growth to drive expansion.\n",
      "Primary key": 43,
      "Public Sector Actor": " Vnsteel, the state-owned leader, initially struggled due to financial and technical limitations but helped set industry foundations. The government’s decision not to favor SOEs allowed private enterprises to flourish, creating a competitive and market-driven flat rolled iron industry. By 2017, the government committed to privatizing Vnsteel, further strengthening the role of private enterprises in shaping the industry.",
      "Public Sector - One Bullet Summary": "The safeguard measures introduced in 2016 protected domestic flat rolled iron producers, enhancing their competitiveness amidst high import penetration and promoting the industry's growth without favoring SOEs.",
      "Private Sector Pioneering Firm": "After Vietnam’s Doi Moi liberalization, domestic business groups emerged as central actors in the industrial transformation of the metals sector Domestic conglomerates like Hoa Sen Group (HSG), a private joint-stock company, emerged as the top domestic producers of surface-treated flat steel, showcasing the success of Vietnam’s private sector in a liberalized market. Thes econglomerates made massive capital investments in integrated steel mills, rolling plants, and downstream processing facilities.\n",
      "Private Sector Industry Growth": " Vietnam’s flat rolled iron industry expanded rapidly due to private sector investments, with companies like HSG installing their own cold rolling mills to enhance self-sufficiency. By 2016, private enterprises controlled 66.7% of the surface-treated sheets market, demonstrating their dominance in production and exports. The availability of a growing domestic market and export demand encouraged continuous investment in advanced manufacturing, making local firms globally competitive. Moreover, the vertical integration of domestic conglomerates across mining, steelmaking, and finished products reduced dependence on imported intermediates and improved export competitiveness.",
      "Private Sector - One Bullet Summary": "Hoa Sen Group led the enhancement of self-sufficiency in Vietnam’s flat rolled iron industry by investing in cold rolling mills, boosting local production capacity for exports.",
      "External Market Factors": "The country’s strategic participation in regional and global trade pacts created open market access for Vietnamese producers, while the increasing global demand for steel in construction, automotive, and infrastructure provided a sustained growth opportunity. Between 2009 and 2018, global apparent steel use grew steadily by 38%, rising from 1.2 billion metric tons to 1.7 billion metric tons, as markets recovered from the global financial crisis. This consistent upward trend in global steel consumption supported expanding opportunities for Vietnam’s steel producers in export markets.\n\n\n ",
      "External Actor Contribution": " Foreign companies, such as POSCO Vietnam (South Korea) and China Steel Sumikin Vietnam (CSVC - Taiwan & Japan), played a major role in industry expansion by investing in large-scale cold rolling mills. Vietnam’s liberalized trade and investment policies attracted foreign capital, enabling technological advancements, production efficiency, and export expansion. ",
      "Outcome": "Through reforms, Vietnam shifted from exporting small volumes of mined ores to exporting processed metals and metal products, especially steel, aluminum, and fabricated goods. By 2022, metals and metal products accounted for about 10–15% of total exports, with steel, aluminum, and copper-based goods leading growth. In 2022, approximately 33.4% of Vietnam's employed population was engaged in the industry and construction sectors. In the first half of 2024, Vietnam exported 6.49 million tons of steel alone, generating nearly $4.78 billion.",

However, in the mid-2010s, mining was still harmed by state paritcipation, especially the initial 51% local ownership requirement (later relaxed). After 2017, under Zimbabwe's new Open for Business policy, the government relaxed local ownership laws, signed new mining agreements, and streamlined licensing, allowing for greater foreign investment in the mining sector. ",
      "Primary key": 35,
      "Public Sector Actor": " The Ministry of Mines and Mining Development has struggled with poor regulatory enforcement and corruption, including double allocations of mining claims in exchange for bribes. \n●  The government’s reluctance to digitize the cadastre system, despite recommendations from the Auditor General in 2010, has further fueled disputes over mining rights. \n●  Legal uncertainty has weakened investment confidence, slowing down the expansion of gold production for export. However, public institutions improved post-2017, and have begun promoting value addition, particularly in PGM smelting and lithium processing.",
      "Public Sector - One Bullet Summary": "After 2017, under Zimbabwe's new Open for Business policy, the mining sector became more attractive to foreign investment.",
      "Private Sector Pioneering Firm": " The Zimbabwe Miners’ Federation (ZMF), representing small and medium-scale miners, has played a crucial role in expanding local participation in gold mining. However, its leadership has been embroiled in corruption scandals, including Henrietta Rushwaya’s 2020 gold smuggling case. Despite governance challenges, artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) has grown significantly, with over 500,000 small-scale miners supporting around 3 million people. The rise of figures like Pedzai \"Scott\" Sakupwanya, a former gold dealer who transitioned to formal mining, has inspired many young Zimbabweans to see mining as a pathway to wealth.",
      "Private Sector Industry Growth": "The economic downturn and high global gold prices have pushed more Zimbabweans into informal mining, with estimates suggesting 1.5 million artisanal miners in the sector. \n●  ASM now dominates Zimbabwe’s gold production, but many miners operate outside the formal economy due to low prices offered by Fidelity Printers and Refiners (FPR), the country’s sole gold buyer. \n●  This has fueled a thriving black market and rampant smuggling, with gold often illegally exported through South Africa and the UAE. \n●  While informal mining is plagued by corruption and criminal networks, it remains a critical source of employment and poverty alleviation, particularly for the youth. ",
      "Private Sector - One Bullet Summary": "Pedzai \"Scott\" Sakupwanya transitioned from gold dealing to formal mining, inspiring youth and contributing to a rise in artisanal and small-scale mining's crucial role in Zimbabwe's gold exports.",
      "External Market Factors": "The global surge in gold prices, particularly during periods of economic crisis, has driven increased demand for Zimbabwean gold. \n●  Following the 2008 financial crisis, the Producer Price Index (PPI) for gold rose by 2.6 percent in 2008 and surged another 12.8 percent in 2009, as economic instability and monetary easing policies pushed investors toward gold as a safe-haven asset. \n●  As a highly liquid and easily tradable commodity, gold helped Zimbabwe’s mining sector remain attractive despite persistent governance challenges. \n●  However, the undervaluation of gold by Fidelity Printers and Refiners (FPR) incentivized the growth of a parallel black market, with Zimbabwean gold often smuggled to South Africa, the UAE, and other international buyers offering better prices.\n",
      "External Actor Contribution": "Foreign buyers, particularly from the UAE and China, continue to source Zimbabwean gold through both formal and informal channels, further entrenching Zimbabwe’s dependence on external markets for gold exports. Chinese investment surged in the 2010s–2020s, particularly in lithium and chrome, under the Belt and Road framework. ",
      "Outcome": "By 2022, gold became Zimbabwe’s top export, contributing over 60% of total export earnings and reinforcing the sector as a key pillar of economic growth.
