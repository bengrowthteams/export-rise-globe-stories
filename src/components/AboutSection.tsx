                The <span className="font-bold text-green-600">Sector Transformation Atlas</span> documents and maps 82 export booms since 1995 that have reshaped emerging economies around the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                As economies have transformed over the past decades, lifting millions of people out of poverty, many countries have experienced episodes of rapid export growth in specific sectors. Often these cases and the stories behind them are not commonly known, even by international development experts.
              </p>
              <p>
                We created the Sector Transformation Atlas to document these export boomsâ€“what happened and the key factors that spurred growth. The map is designed for both policymakers and funders of economic development, to inspire by showing what is possible and to inform by distilling lessons from successes.

                  We identified export success stories in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) through a systematic approach using global trade data accessed from the Atlas of Economic Complexity (which is itself based on data from UN Comtrade). For each country in each sector, we ranked export performance globally and compared the rankings across two benchmark years: 1995 and 2022.
                </p>
                <p className="font-medium">Cases were included if they met both of the following criteria:</p>
                <div className="bg-purple-50 p-6 rounded-xl border-l-4 border-purple-500">
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li><span className="font-semibold">An improvement of at least 15 places</span> in global export ranking from 1995 to 2022</li>
                    <li><span className="font-semibold">A final ranking of 60th or better</span> in 2022</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                  This criteria emphasizes cases with both significant export growth (improvement over the time period) and international competitiveness (final ranking). We use data from 1995 to 2022 given data availability and consistent product categories over this time period. This approach yielded 100 cases across 9 sectors: Agriculture (9), Chemicals (10), Electronics (10), Machinery (7), Metals (8), Stones (17), Services (14), Textiles (12), and Vehicles (13). Each case consists of a country-sector pair. We used the Harmonized System (HS) 1992 for sector classification.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the final map visualization we excluded countries that the World Bank defined as high-income in 1995 in order to focus our data set exclusively on development in low- and middle income economies.

                <p>
                  After filtering the trade data based on the aforementioned criteria, we conducted detailed desk research based on available secondary sources (e.g. academic papers, industry reports, case studies) to identify the policy choices, private investments, and external influences that shaped each success. In our research, we prioritized official government sources, international reports (UN, WTO, and World Bank), industry reports, and academic studies over news articles and commentary pieces.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We then produced concise, accessible case narratives, focused on highlighting specific individuals and firms, and their catalytic actions, rather than exhaustive histories. The methodology for case research is detailed in the project codebook, and allows others to produce cases in the same format. After compiling case narratives, we reviewed, fact-checked, and revised all cases for accuracy and consistency.

                  AI-powered tools were used across the project lifecycle. In the research phase, AI search engines were used as a starting point to understand the possible policies and actors that influenced a country's sectoral export boom. These ideas were supplemented by academic journal and policy document searches that provided corroboration and additional detail. When writing up the case studies, AI was not used directly, but prompts were used for formatting and summarization. The "Key Highlights" and "Success Story" sentences in the case studies, which summarize human-written information, were generated by GPT-powered tools. For web development, all coding was done by no-code AI tools (notably Lovable), directed by human prompting and refinement.
